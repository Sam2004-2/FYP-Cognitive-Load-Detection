# Cognitive Load Estimation - Regression Configuration
# For training continuous load_0_1 target from StressID self-assessments
#
# This config extends default.yaml - only regression-specific settings are defined here.
# Common settings (windows, quality, blink, paths, logging) are inherited from default.yaml.

# Task mode: "classification" or "regression"
task_mode: "regression"

# Regression model configuration
regression:
  model_type: "ridge"  # "ridge", "rf" (RandomForest), or "xgb" (XGBoost/GradientBoosting)

  # Ridge regression parameters
  ridge_params:
    alpha: 1.0  # Regularization strength

  # RandomForest parameters
  rf_params:
    n_estimators: 100
    max_depth: 10
    min_samples_leaf: 5
    n_jobs: -1

  # XGBoost/GradientBoosting parameters
  xgb_params:
    n_estimators: 100
    max_depth: 4
    learning_rate: 0.1
    min_samples_leaf: 5

# Cross-validation configuration
cv:
  method: "group_kfold"  # "group_kfold" or "loso" (leave-one-subject-out)
  n_splits: 5            # Number of folds for GroupKFold

# Session-level evaluation aggregation
session_agg:
  method: "mean"  # "mean" or "median" for aggregating window predictions

# Task filtering - only these tasks are used for training
tasks:
  - "Math"
  - "Counting1"
  - "Counting2"
  - "Speaking"

# Evaluation configuration (overrides default)
eval:
  metrics: ["mae", "rmse", "spearman", "r2"]
  report_window_level: true   # Also report window-level metrics (for debugging)
  report_session_level: true  # Primary evaluation level
